## Meet Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. A web framework provides a structure and starting point for creating your application, allowing you to focus on creating something amazing while we sweat the details.

Laravel strives to provide an amazing developer experience while providing powerful features such as thorough dependency injection, an expressive database abstraction layer, queues and scheduled jobs, unit and integration testing, and more.

Whether you are new to PHP web frameworks or have years of experience, Laravel is a framework that can grow with you. We'll help you take your first steps as a web developer or give you a boost as you take your expertise to the next level. We can't wait to see what you build.

> New to Laravel? Check out the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com/) for a hands-on tour of the framework while we walk you through building your first Laravel application.

## Why Laravel?

There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a web application. However, we believe Laravel is the best choice for building modern, full-stack web applications.

A Progressive Framework
We like to call Laravel a "progressive" framework. By that, we mean that Laravel grows with you. If you're just taking your first steps into web development, Laravel's vast library of documentation, guides, and [video tutorials](https://laracasts.com/) will help you learn the ropes without becoming overwhelmed.

If you're a senior developer, Laravel gives you robust tools for [dependency injection](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/container), [unit testing](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/testing), [queues](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/queues), [real-time events](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/broadcasting), and more. Laravel is fine-tuned for building professional web applications and ready to handle enterprise work loads.

A Scalable Framework
Laravel is incredibly scalable. Thanks to the scaling-friendly nature of PHP and Laravel's built-in support for fast, distributed cache systems like Redis, horizontal scaling with Laravel is a breeze. In fact, Laravel applications have been easily scaled to handle hundreds of millions of requests per month.

Need extreme scaling? Platforms like [Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com/) allow you to run your Laravel application at nearly limitless scale on AWS's latest serverless technology.

A Community Framework
Laravel combines the best packages in the PHP ecosystem to offer the most robust and developer friendly framework available. In addition, thousands of talented developers from around the world have [contributed to the framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework). Who knows, maybe you'll even become a Laravel contributor.

## Your First Laravel Project

Before creating your first Laravel project, you should ensure that your local machine has PHP and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed. If you are developing on macOS, PHP and Composer can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). In addition, we recommend [installing Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/pt).

After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via the Composer `create-project` command:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel:^9.0 example-app
```

Or, you may create new Laravel projects by globally installing the Laravel installer via Composer:

```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
 
laravel new example-app
```

After the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using the Laravel's Artisan CLI `serve` command:

```bash
cd example-app
 
php artisan serve
```

Once you have started the Artisan development server, your application will be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:8000`. Next, you're ready to [start taking your next steps into the Laravel ecosystem](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation#next-steps). Of course, you may also want to [configure a database](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation#databases-and-migrations).

> If you would like a head start when developing your Laravel application, consider using one of our starter kits. Laravel's [starter kits](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/starter-kits) provide backend and frontend authentication scaffolding for your new Laravel application.

## Laravel & Docker

We want it to be as easy as possible to get started with Laravel regardless of your preferred operating system. So, there are a variety of options for developing and running a Laravel project on your local machine. While you may wish to explore these options at a later time, Laravel provides [Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/sail), a built-in solution for running your Laravel project using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Docker is a tool for running applications and services in small, light-weight "containers" which do not interfere with your local machine's installed software or configuration. This means you don't have to worry about configuring or setting up complicated development tools such as web servers and databases on your local machine. To get started, you only need to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

Laravel Sail is a light-weight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration. Sail provides a great starting point for building a Laravel application using PHP, MySQL, and Redis without requiring prior Docker experience.

> Already a Docker expert? Don't worry! Everything about Sail can be customized using the `docker-compose.yml` file included with Laravel.

## Getting Started On macOS

If you're developing on a Mac and [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) is already installed, you can use a simple terminal command to create a new Laravel project. For example, to create a new Laravel application in a directory named "example-app", you may run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -s "https://laravel.build/example-app" | bash
```

Of course, you can change "example-app" in this URL to anything you like - just make sure the application name only contains alpha-numeric characters, dashes, and underscores. The Laravel application's directory will be created within the directory you execute the command from.

Sail installation may take several minutes while Sail's application containers are built on your local machine.

After the project has been created, you can navigate to the application directory and start Laravel Sail. Laravel Sail provides a simple command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker configuration:

```bash
cd example-app
 
./vendor/bin/sail up
```

Once the application's Docker containers have been started, you can access the application in your web browser at: [http://localhost](http://localhost).
