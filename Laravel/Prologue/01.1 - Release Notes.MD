## Versioning Scheme

Laravel and its other first-party packages follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Major framework releases are released every year (~February), while minor and patch releases may be released as often as every week. Minor and patch releases should never contain breaking changes.

When referencing the Laravel framework or its components from your application or package, you should always use a version constraint such as `^9.0`, since major releases of Laravel do include breaking changes. However, we strive to always ensure you may update to a new major release in one day or less.

### Named Arguments

[Named arguments](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.named-arguments) are not covered by Laravel's backwards compatibility guidelines. We may choose to rename function arguments when necessary in order to improve the Laravel codebase. Therefore, using named arguments when calling Laravel methods should be done cautiously and with the understanding that the parameter names may change in the future.

## Support Policy

For all Laravel releases, bug fixes are provided for 18 months and security fixes are provided for 2 years. For all additional libraries, including Lumen, only the latest major release receives bug fixes. In addition, please review the database versions [supported by Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/database#introduction).

## Laravel 9

As you may know, Laravel transitioned to yearly releases with the release of Laravel 8. Previously, major versions were released every 6 months. This transition is intended to ease the maintenance burden on the community and challenge our development team to ship amazing, powerful new features without introducing breaking changes. Therefore, we have shipped a variety of robust features to Laravel 8 without breaking backwards compatibility, such as parallel testing support, improved Breeze starter kits, HTTP client improvements, and even new Eloquent relationship types such as "has one of many".

Therefore, this commitment to ship great new features during the current release will likely lead to future "major" releases being primarily used for "maintenance" tasks such as upgrading upstream dependencies, which can be seen in these release notes.

Laravel 9 continues the improvements made in Laravel 8.x by introducing support for Symfony 6.0 components, Symfony Mailer, Flysystem 3.0, improved `route:list` output, a Laravel Scout database driver, new Eloquent accessor / mutator syntax, implicit route bindings via Enums, and a variety of other bug fixes and usability improvements.

## PHP 8.0

Laravel 9.x requires a minimum PHP version of 8.0.

## Symfony Mailer

Symfony Mailer support was contributed by [Dries Vints](https://github.com/driesvints), [James Brooks](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/releases#versioning-scheme), and [Julius Kiekbusch](https://github.com/Jubeki).

Previous releases of Laravel utilized the Swift Mailer library to send outgoing email. However, that library is no longer maintained and has been succeeded by Symfony Mailer.

Please review the [upgrade guide](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/upgrade#symfony-mailer) to learn more about ensuring your application is compatible with Symfony Mailer.

## Flysystem 3.x

Flysystem 3.x support was contributed by [Dries Vints](https://github.com/driesvints).

Laravel 9.x upgrades our upstream Flysystem dependency to Flysystem 3.x. Flysystem powers all of filesystem interactions offered by the `Storage` facade.

Please review the [upgrade guide](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/upgrade#flysystem-3) to learn more about ensuring your application is compatible with Flysystem 3.x.

## Improved Eloquent Accessors / Mutators

Improved Eloquent accessors / mutators was contributed by [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell).

Laravel 9.x offers a new way to define Eloquent accessors and mutators. In previous releases of Laravel, the only way to define [accessors and mutators](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent-mutators#accessors-and-mutators) was by defining prefixed methods on your model like so:

```php
public function getNameAttribute($value)
{
    return strtoupper($value);
}
 
public function setNameAttribute($value)
{
    $this->attributes['name'] = $value;
}
```

However, in Laravel 9.x you may define an accessor and mutator using a single, non-prefixed method by type-hinting a return type of `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\Attribute`:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\Attribute;
 
public function name(): Attribute
{
    return new Attribute(
        get: fn ($value) => strtoupper($value),
        set: fn ($value) => $value,
    );
}
```

In addition, this new approach to defining accessors will cache object values that are returned by the attribute, just like [custom cast classes](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/eloquent-mutators#custom-casts):

```php
use App\Support\Address;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Casts\Attribute;
 
public function address(): Attribute
{
    return new Attribute(
        get: fn ($value, $attributes) => new Address(
            $attributes['address_line_one'],
            $attributes['address_line_two'],
        ),
        set: fn (Address $value) => [
            'address_line_one' => $value->lineOne,
            'address_line_two' => $value->lineTwo,
        ],
    );
}
```
